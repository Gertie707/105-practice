                <h4>Oh the Places You'll Go!</h4>
                
                <p>I'm sure Dr. Seuss didn't know much about computers in his day but he defintely knew that new experiences make life worth living!</p>

                <p>I never thought I would have as much fun coding as I do.  Every day is an opportunity to twist and turn the learning curve into a brand new coding pretzel!</p>
 
                <p>If you find pleasure in solving problems and developing a creation wrought by your own hands, you will enjoy developing your own apps!  I guarantee it!</p>
 
                <h4>Why, What, Where, and When???  How too???</h4>

                <p>Do you like asking questions and dissecting how something came to be and then figuring how to make it even better?</p>
 
                <p>Do you like pounding your head against a wall when you can't figure something out?  Coding is perfect for you then!  Just kidding!</p>

                <p>While sometimes coding can be frustrating, I have learned you can't push yourself to learn something until you are ready.  But it is so exciting when you finally get how something works!  It is the best feeling! </p>
